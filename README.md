# 🪟 Overview
This project is designed to create cards with questions and their answers.

 - Create a new card.
 - Delete an existing card.
 - List all existing cards.
   
# 📋 Solution

 Basic OOP concepts are used: classes, objects. Organize Python code into multiple modules and maintain clear, reusable class structures. Strictly separate individual class structures and their methods. Separate code into separate actions, relative to the main menu of the program.
 
# ⚒️ System operation

In the current program for developing various cards,
objects have been created through two classes.
In the first class, the objects of the various cards themselves with the corresponding questions and answers to them have been created.
In the second class, the cards are recorded and stored in a dictionary to facilitate the use and organization of the information in them.

From the main menu, the user can select the corresponding function of the program to:
- create a new card with the corresponding question and answer to it
- change an existing card
- delete a card
- retrieve a list of all cards already added to the dictionary

Validations have been added to the code to check that the user has not entered an invalid option in the menu and to avoid other errors when executing the methods.
